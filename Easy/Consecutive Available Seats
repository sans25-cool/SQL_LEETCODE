-- Table: Cinema

-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | seat_id     | int  |
-- | free        | bool |
-- +-------------+------+
-- seat_id is an auto-increment primary key column for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
 
-- Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

-- Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.

-- The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

-- SQL Code:

select distinct(a.seat_id) from cinema a,cinema b
where abs(a.seat_id-b.seat_id)=1
and a.free=1 and b.free=1
order by a.seat_id;
